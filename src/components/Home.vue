        <p>Our founder developed Gusto Farm to Street around his experience growing up on his family’s farm in Pennsylvania.</p>
        <blockquote

        >AS A YOUNG BOY, HE LEARNED THAT HARD WORK WAS REWARDED WITH HEALTHY, HEARTY MEALS - STRAIGHT FROM THE FARM.</blockquote>
        <p>After moving to New York City, Gusto's founder’s budding passion turned to the emerging food scene. He became obsessed with the idea of receiving a fast, fresh, healthy meal at a reasonable price and felt that with the right team he could execute it better than anyone else.</p>
        <blockquote
          class="font-weight-bold"
        >THIS PASSION EVENTUALLY GREW INTO AN IDEA FOR A GATHERING PLACE WHERE LIKE-MINDED INDIVIDUALS COULD MEET TO ENJOY AMAZING FOOD IN A UNIQUE ENVIRONMENT.</blockquote>
        <p>
          Gusto’s menu has been carefully crafted by our award winning chef with casual offerings that best utilize healthy grains and greens, hormone and antibiotic free meats, as well as fresh, locally sourced produce and ingredient when available. With scratch kitchens to
          complement our vibrant farm-to-table flavors, we always strive to offer our guests an unparalleled dining experience.
